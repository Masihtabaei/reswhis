## General Information

After countless hours of testing various packages, libraries, and frameworks, we realized there was no **remote**, **robust**, **language-agnostic** WebSocket solution for real-time audio transcription using OpenAIâ€™s Whisper. Existing solutions were usually error-prone, restricted to local use or sophisticated.

Inspired by the **stream socket** (i. e. communication over **TCP**) server implementation of "placeholder", we decided to develop our own WebSocket server for Whisper-based streaming transcription.

Main characteristics of our implementation:
- **Simple**: Done merely over a weekend by an undergrad student.
- **Websocket-based**: Broader client support (also possible to integrate into web apps without native socket support)
- **Parallel server**: Simultaneous transcription for multiple clients.
